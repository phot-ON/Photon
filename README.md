# What is Photon?

Photon is a React Native mobile application designed to simplify photo sharing when hanging out with friends. It allows users to create and join a session where every picture taken by anyone in the group is instantly synced to every participantâ€™s device in real-time. No more tedious manual sharing through messaging apps or cloud servicesâ€”Photon automates the process, making sure every memory is shared with the group instantly.
